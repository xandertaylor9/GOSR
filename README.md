# GOSR (Game Operating System Runtime) - Technical Specification

## Overview
GOSR is a modular, system-level runtime designed to revolutionize how games run across all platforms. It abstracts away hardware and OS fragmentation, enabling consistent, fast, and secure gameplay with dynamic hot-swapping, peer-to-peer networking, real-time updates, and AI-native capabilities.

GOSR is not a game engine ‚Äî it's a game runtime platform. Unlike engines such as Unity or Unreal, which provide tools for asset creation, scripting, physics, and rendering pipelines within individual games, GOSR functions more like a shared operating layer beneath the engine. It provides standardized services such as graphics abstraction, hot-swappable module loading, P2P networking, voice and stream handling, security/cert validation, and moderation infrastructure. Game engines (or even raw codebases) plug into GOSR and build on top of it. Think of it like the JVM for games or like SteamOS but deeply integrated across runtime, networking, and distribution. It doesn't replace engines ‚Äî it empowers them by offloading low-level concerns and providing a consistent, secure, cross-platform runtime environment.

many modern engines like Unity, Unreal, and Godot already provide abstraction layers over platform-specific graphics APIs. However, GOSR's approach differs in scope, placement, and purpose:
Traditional engines abstract at the engine level, meaning each game must embed its own runtime, manage updates per title, and reimplement optimization strategies independently. GOSR, on the other hand, aims to elevate that abstraction to the system layer ‚Äî a shared runtime across all games. This allows:
Global optimizations (e.g., batching across modules or games),
Real-time hot-swapping of graphical modules without restarting the engine,
Uniform GPU scheduling via vendor-provided micro-drivers,
Consolidated AI/voice/modding/network support across games,
And critically, modular updates and rollback at the runtime level, not per-game.

- Eliminate downtime via modular hot-swapping updates
- Improve accessibility for smaller studios
- Support peer-to-peer networking with shard logic for massive multiplayer experiences
- Embed anti-piracy, moderation, and AI tools at the system layer
- Abstract rendering, input, voice, and streaming away from native APIs

### üéÆ Graphics Abstraction Layer
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe6f153f-e30f-4ca3-a3c6-2596dc5834bd)


#### Design
The Graphics Abstraction Layer (GAL) serves as a translation and orchestration layer between game logic and platform-specific GPU APIs. It provides a unified rendering API for all games, eliminating the need for developers to write platform-specific rendering code.

#### Workflow
1. Games call the GOSR unified graphics API.
2. GAL converts calls into platform-specific API instructions (DirectX12, Vulkan, Metal, WebGPU).
3. Commands are batched and queued for optimal GPU submission.
4. GPU vendors provide a minimal tuning driver responsible only for translating GAL ops to hardware-specific instructions.

#### Responsibilities
| Stakeholder | Responsibility |
|------------|----------------|
| GOSR Team | Design and maintain IRenderer interface and abstraction logic |
| Game Developer | Write against GOSR Graphics API only |
| GPU Vendor | Provide micro-drivers to translate GAL ops to native GPU commands |
| OS Vendor | Expose minimal GPU resources and scheduling APIs |

#### Features
- Zero-copy render pipeline with frame batching
- Built-in support for streaming texture formats
- Temporal upscaling and DLSS-like hooks
- Internal render graph optimizer
